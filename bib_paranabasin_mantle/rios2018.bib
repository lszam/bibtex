 abstract = "The Jurassic-Cretaceous Sequence of the Parana Basin including eolic sandstones of the Botucatu Formation are superimposed by volcanic eruption from Serra Geral Formation, this sequence has features of volcano-sedimentary interaction between the interface of these two units. Intense basic magmatism and secondarily acidic magmatism covered a huge field of dunes, this magmatism led to origin of several volcano-sedimentary structures. Outcrops of Parana Basin margin, Rio Grande do Sul state show a variety of interaction characteristics between consolidated or unconsolidated sediments, they can be saturated or not of water, basaltic or dacitic composed. Volcano-sedimentary features, found on the base and top of the flow, occur in different forms due to the temperature of the volcanic rocks and the type of sediment. These features can be categorized according to their production process divided in two: interaction with the hot fluid flow and partially crystallized, where the presence of water or moisture on the sediments make the interaction easier; interaction from later processes like erosion and weathering on consolidated flow. Volcano-sedimentary features include: flow streaks, breccias, sandstone dikes, sandstone fractures and geodes.",
